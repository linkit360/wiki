### Reporter 

Collects all new data from the other platform services, aggregates them and sends to the admin interface via [[acceptor]] service.

=== Configuration === 

```yaml
app_name: reporter
server:
  rpc_port: 50315
  http_port: 50316
collector:
  provider: cheese
db:
  ..simple db config as everywhere
acceptor_client:
  ..simple rpc client 
```

```provider: cheese``` -- here we set up the provider name for data collection.

Control Panel doesn't know anything about the provider's name for certain provider instance 

### Previous AD report 

<spoiler |We used o use crontab aggregate scripts saved data to the db>

### Now AD report 

Now, we have a special service so called `Reporter` that collects data and aggregates it, per second.
Each second we send the data to the acceptor on the XMP side.

Reporter report for AD has the following aggregate format:

```go
type Aggregate struct {
	ReportDate   int64  `json:"report_date,omitempty"`
	CampaignId   int64  `json:"id_campaign,omitempty"`
	Provider     string `json:"id_provider,omitempty"`
	OperatorCode int64  `json:"operator_code,omitempty"`
	LPHits       int64  `json:"lp_hits,omitempty"`
	LPMsisdnHits int64  `json:"lp_msisdn_hits,omitempty"`
	Mo           int64  `json:"mo,omitempty"`
	MoUniq       int64  `json:"mo_uniq,omitempty"`
	MoCharge     int64  `json:"mo_charge,omitempty"`
	RetryCharge  int64  `json:"retry_charge,omitempty"`
	Pixels       int64  `json:"total_pixels_sent,omitempty"`
}
```


Added: 

* id_provider (aka partner): cheese, qrtech, yondu, mobilink, etc 
* operator_code
* retry charge 

Differencies:

*  mo_charge is count of **paid** new MO
* retry charge is count of **paid** retries
