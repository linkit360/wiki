# Logs 

You can view job logs about the queried data in a separate file, file from log_path column (xmp_jobs).

Logging format:

* injection job: id = line number
* expired job: id = id_retry

* action - the action we apply (same for dry_run and not)
* error - in case of any error
* msisdn is original row from file for injection

**If no action - it's the error of jobs service. Action must be specified always** 

Log examples:

* time="2017-02-01T10:39:20Z" level=info msg=123123123123 action=skip error="Wrong prefix: 123123123123" id=1
