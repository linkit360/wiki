====== Formatting Syntax ======

[[doku>DokuWiki]] supports some simple markup language, which tries to make the datafiles to be as readable as possible. This page contains all possible syntax you may use when editing the pages. Simply have a look at the source of this page by pressing "Edit this page". If you want to try something, just use the [[playground:playground|playground]] page. The simpler markup is easily accessible via [[doku>toolbar|quickbuttons]], too.

===== Basic Text Formatting =====

DokuWiki supports **bold**, //italic//, __underlined__ and ''monospaced'' texts. Of course you can **__//''combine''//__** all these.

You can use <sub>subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup>, too.

You can mark something as <del>deleted</del> as well.

**Paragraphs** are created from blank lines. If you want to **force a newline** without a paragraph, you can use two backslashes followed by a whitespace or the end of line.

This is some text with some linebreaks\\ Note that the
two backslashes are only recognized at the end of a line\\
or followed by\\ a whitespace \\this happens without it.

You should use forced newlines only if really needed.

===== Links =====

DokuWiki supports multiple ways of creating links.

==== External ====

External links are recognized automagically: http://www.google.com or simply www.google.com - You can set the link text as well: [[http://www.google.com|This Link points to google]]. Email addresses like this one: <andi@splitbrain.org> are recognized, too.

==== Internal ====

Internal links are created by using square brackets. You can either just give a [[pagename]] or use an additional [[pagename|link text]].

[[doku>pagename|Wiki pagenames]] are converted to lowercase automatically, special characters are not allowed.

You can use [[some:namespaces]] by using a colon in the pagename.

For details about namespaces see [[doku>namespaces]].

Linking to a specific section is possible, too. Just add the section name behind a hash character as known from HTML. This links to [[syntax#internal|this Section]].

  This links to [[syntax#internal|this Section]].

Notes:

  * Links to [[syntax|existing pages]] are shown in a different style from [[nonexisting]] ones.
  * DokuWiki does not use [[wp>CamelCase]] to automatically create links by default, but this behavior can be enabled in the [[doku>config]] file. Hint: If DokuWiki is a link, then it's enabled.
  * When a section's heading is changed, its bookmark changes, too. So don't rely on section linking too much.

==== Interwiki ====

DokuWiki supports [[doku>Interwiki]] links. These are quick links to other Wikis. For example this is a link to Wikipedia's page about Wikis: [[wp>Wiki]].

==== Windows Shares ====

Windows shares like [[\\server\share|this]] are recognized, too. Please note that these only make sense in a homogeneous user group like a corporate [[wp>Intranet]].

  Windows Shares like [[\\server\share|this]] are recognized, too.

Notes:

  * For security reasons direct browsing of windows shares only works in Microsoft Internet Explorer per default (and only in the "local zone").
  * For Mozilla and Firefox it can be enabled through different workaround mentioned in the [[http://kb.mozillazine.org/Links_to_local_pages_do_not_work|Mozilla Knowledge Base]]. However, there will still be a JavaScript warning about trying to open a Windows Share. To remove this warning (for all users), put the following line in ''conf/lang/en/lang.php'' (more details at [[doku>localization#changing_some_localized_texts_and_strings_in_your_installation|localization]]): <code - conf/lang/en/lang.php>
<?php
/**
 * Customization of the english language file
 * Copy only the strings that needs to be modified
 */
$lang['js']['nosmblinks'] = '';
</code>

==== Image Links ====

You can also use an image to link to another internal or external page by combining the syntax for links and [[#images_and_other_files|images]] (see below) like this:
