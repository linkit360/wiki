No any automation.

* Create a backup folder, usually named linkit-old
* Copy configs from dev to mobilink-1
* Check, configs have been changed since last deploy
* Make diffs, configure properly
* Separately on-by-one, run new binaries with new configs, checking them that ok (modules would fail : port is buzy)
* finally, module restart order as following:

1) InMemory
2) Contentd
3) Dispatcher, Pixels, QListener, MtManager

If smth goes wrong, rename new linkit to linkit-new. **COPY** lonkit-old to linkit, restart.
